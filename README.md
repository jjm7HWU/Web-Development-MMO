## Demonstration


Group Coursework Demonstration: [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZthHMapSwQk)

## Deployment

The web-based game is running here, in a free hosted server in this [link](https://python-mmo.herokuapp.com/). 

(The host might take a bit to load the first time because it hibernates during long periods of inactivity)
